# whatsapp_auto_join_groups
This project is for joining bunch of whatsapp groups automatically and sending messages to them.

How this code works is that it takes a whatsapp group from an excel file and sends it to your personal chat, then it clicks on that link and joins the group, and yes it will send lets say 200 messages if you have 200 groups in your excel sheet, not the best way but it works.

I will upload a video on youtube to explain how it works exactly.

To make it work, you have to do the following:
1. Scan the QR Code by going to your whatsapp app, click the three dots in the top right of the corner, then click "Linked Devices" > "Link a device" and scan the QR Code shown in the website.
2. Type the number you want the messages to be sent to, or type the name of the group, It is better to make a group so you can easily delete it later.
3. Enter your links in the excel file named "dataset".


Please note that is still doesnt work on broken or full groups, so make sure all your groups are not full and not broken.

and you are good to go!
i will make more changes in the future.
